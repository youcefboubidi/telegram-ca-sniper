# telegram-ca-sniper
Snipes (auto buys) solana tokens that are sent on a specific chat you are watching with the help of nova bot. Browser-based script using puppeteer.
# Use Instructions
```bash
npm install
node snipe.mjs
```
- After the browser windows pops up, login to your telegram account manually.
- Open in a new tab nova sniper bot telegram channel and set up your sniper.
- In the same tab you logged in on, open the chat/channel you are waiting to drop CA
- go to the terminal and press enter.

When the channel sends CA, it automatically copies it and pastes it into the next TAB (nova sniper TAB) which automatically buys the token according to your presets.
